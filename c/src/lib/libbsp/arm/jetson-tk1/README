BSP for the Jetson tk1 ARM board

It currently supports the following devices:
  - Console using UART-D on DB9 connector and UART-A on the J3A2 Pin header
  - Clock using the ARM internal timer
  - Benchmark timer using the Nvidia Generic Timer TimerUS

Checkout the options described in include/bspopts.h.in to get an overview of how
to get the second console, interrupt driven consoles or jailhouse running

Additionally to those options to run jailhouse someone has then to assign IRQ 68
and 122 to the cell config (UARTA and UARTD)
And assign 0x60005000+0x1000, 0x70006000+0x1000, and 0xf8000000+0x4000000 (64MB)
to the cell config, load RTEMS at address 0x0 and start it
