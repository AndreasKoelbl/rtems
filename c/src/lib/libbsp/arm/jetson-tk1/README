BSP for the Jetson TK1 ARM board

This BSP currently supports the following devices:
  - Console using UART-D on DB9 connector and UART-A on the J3A2 Pin header
  - Clock using the ARM internal CP15 timer
  - Benchmark timer using the Nvidia Generic Timer TimerUS
  - GPIOs

Checkout the options described in include/bspopts.h.in in order to configure
the second console, make the console interrupt driven or run the RTEMS
application inside a jailhouse cell.

Currently, following IRQs are used:
  - 122 (if configured NS8250_CONSOLE_USE_INTERRUPTS=1)
  - 68 (if configured NS8250_USE_SECONDARY_CONSOLE=1)
  - 119 for the GPIO_6 bank (PU0 - PU6)

Also allow the following memory regions:
  - UARTA 0x40@0x70006000
  - UARTD 0x40@0x70006300
  - Nvidia Timers 0x1000@0x60005000
  - RAM 64MB@0x90000000
  - PINMUX AUX 0x1000@0x70003000
  - GPIO 0x1000@0x6000d000
