BSP for the Jetson tk1 ARM board

It currently supports the following devices:
  - Console using UART-D on DB9 connector and UART-A on the J3A2 Pin header
  - Clock using the ARM internal timer
  - Benchmark timer using the Nvidia Generic Timer TimerUS

Checkout the options described in include/bspopts.h.in to get an overview of how
to get the second console, interrupt driven consoles or jailhouse running.

Additionally to those options to run jailhouse someone has then to assign IRQ:
  - 122 (if configured NS8250_CONSOLE_USE_INTERRUPTS=1)
  - 68 (if configured NS8250_USE_SECONDARY_CONSOLE=1)
  - 119 for the GPIO_6 bank (PU0 - PU6)

Then allow the following memory regions:
  - UARTA and UARTD  0x70006000+0x1000,
  - Nvidia Timers 0x60005000+0x1000,
  - RAM 0xf8000000+0x4000000 (64MB)
  - GPIO 0x6000d000+0x1000
  - PINMUX AUX 0x70003000+0x1000
